Schedule:
1.Try a complete demo on SSD mobilenet series(any of them is ok).
2.Make a choice between changing the model input(there's a problem on input array dimension and it's implicitly found, which is probobly related to Transform.py) and build a open-image format fold based on provided datasets source.
3.get the model trained by defult setting, use some visulization toolkit to desplay the result
4.install the quartus.
